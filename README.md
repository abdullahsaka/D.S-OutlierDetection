# Outlier Detection Algorithms in R 

This repository shows how to implement outlier detection algorithms in R Studio.

Outlier detection algorithms are as follows of: Box-Whisker Method,
                                                MAD Method,
                                                Z-score Method, and 
                                                Twitter Anomaly Detection
